title: The mischeif of sugar and fat

I recently watched [Super Size Me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/) and 
was stunned by the doctors statements at the end of the "experiment". 
First of all, they didn't forsee the implications of the "McDiet", second; 
they called it a *"high fat"* diet!

Now, don't get me wrong. During the 30 days of _McDieting_ Morgan ate 
approximetly 12 lbs of fat. That's 0.4 lbs/day (0.18 kg). That's about the
same as in 8 [avocoado](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1843/2) 
or 7 [eggs](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/111/2).
To be honest. That's not **THAT** much fat. 
I personaly mostly start of my day by eating 3-5 eggs. And that's when I try to loose weight!

Looking instead of the amount of sugar that Morgan processed during the same 
period of time, we find that he ate approximately 30 pounds of sugar. 1 pound a day (0.45 kg) 
of sugar! 
According to (a quick search here) [heart](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Sugars-and-Carbohydrates_UCM_303296_Article.jsp)
they claim that the right amount of sugar is:
>... no more than 100 calories per day, or about 6 teaspoons of sugar. For men, it's 150 calories per day, or about 9 teaspoons.

1 pound of sugar is sure a lot more than 6-9 teaspoons in my book.
